#Run pyscenic_grn.sh and then pyscenic_ctx.sh to generate necessary files. 
#Then, analysis the files with SCENIC_regulon.py
#It may take an hour for runing the demo data. 
#Expected results include an AUCell scores table, a regulon table, a heatmap, and a dotplot for the differential regulons.
#Large files involved in the scripts were downloaded from these urls.
